# ✍️ Project Reflection

## AI Tools Used
What tools did you use (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot)? How did they help?
In this project, I mainly used ChatGPT (GPT-5) and Cursor as my AI development assistants. ChatGPT helped me analyse the logic of each stage, debug functions, and refine my writing for documentation and reflection. Cursor, on the other hand, provided real-time code completion and inline error detection while I was coding in my notebook environment. These two tools complemented each other, they significantly reduced debugging time, enhanced accuracy, and allowed me to maintain a clear development workflow.
## Prompting Techniques
Which intentional prompting strategies did you apply?
I applied step-by-step prompting and refinement prompting techniques. At the beginning, I asked AI to help me outline what knowledge points and Python functions were needed for each section of the project, and to restate the problem in simpler terms to clarify my understanding. Later, I used more specific prompts such as “improve this function but keep the structure unchanged” or gave my own modification suggestions for iterative refinement. I frequently used bilingual prompts in both English and Chinese to ensure conceptual alignment and to minimise misunderstanding between technical and linguistic expressions.
## What Worked Well?
Describe one thing you’re proud of.
What I am most proud of is that nearly a month of effort allowed me to successfully create a complete interactive weather dashboard by applying what I have learned and using AI. It integrates data acquisition, natural language processing, and visualization features. The combination of parse_weather_question() and generate_weather_response() enables the system to understand natural language questions and generate context-aware answers. The interactive design with ipywidgets makes the dashboard more lively and user-friendly.
## What Would You Do Differently?
Describe one thing you'd change if you had more time.
If I had more time, I would plan to study new code to improve my current code, genuinely implementing the creation of web dashboards or weather forecast query apps or pop-ups, in order to enhance visualization and user experience. In addition, I would write automated unit tests for the main functions to improve system maintainability and reduce runtime errors.
## Final Thoughts
Any parting comments on your learning experience?
This project allowed me to deeply realise that AI can provide valuable support throughout all stages of software development. Starting from initial project planning, through debugging, and finally to code testing. As a student without a computer science background, I have learned a great deal during the process of completing this assignment. By using ChatGPT and Cursor and by seeking guidance from my lecturer whenever I encountered problems, I significantly improved my technical reasoning and communication skills. This experience has also made me more confident in using AI responsibly and effectively in both academic and real-world projects.
