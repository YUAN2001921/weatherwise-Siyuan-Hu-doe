ME: I need to create a weather dashboard in Python that uses a provided module to access weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Can you help me restate this problem more clearly to ensure I understand all requirements? And also tell me what codes I will use in the different parts.
AI: You need to build a Python Weather Dashboard that:
```python
1.	Uses a provided weather module (e.g., get_weather_data()) to fetch weather information.
2.	Accepts user input (location, time window, units) and validates it.
3.	Processes and stores the retrieved data safely (ensuring no missing fields cause errors).
4.	Performs calculations, like generating tips (umbrella, jacket, sunscreen).
5.	Displays results in a clear, user-friendly way: text summary + optional chart.
6.	Handles decision logic (menus, fallback if API fails).
7.	Allows repeat operations (refresh loop, batch queries).
```
‚úÖ What Codes Will Be Used in Different Parts
1) INPUT
```python
‚Ä¢	Functions to use:
parse_weather_question(question) collect_inputs_once() 
resolve_ambiguity()
inputs = collect_inputs_once("Perth tomorrow")
location = resolve_ambiguity(inputs["location"])
```
2) OUTPUT
‚Ä¢	Functions to use:
```python
generate_weather_response(parsed, data)
render_summary_block(location, days, current, tip, note)
print_forecast_table(forecast) 
(optional) matplotlib 
summary = render_summary_block("Perth", 3, data["current"], "Bring sunscreen", "Forecasts carry uncertainty")
print(summary)
print_forecast_table(data["forecast"])
```
3) STORE 
‚Ä¢	Functions to use:
```python
ensure_schema_safe(data) 
SESSION dict 
cached_get_weather(location, days) 
data = ensure_schema_safe(get_weather_data("Perth", 3))
SESSION["last_query"] = {"location": "Perth", "days": 3}
SESSION["last_result"] = data
```
4) CALCULATE 
‚Ä¢	Functions to use:
```python
compose_tip(temp, precip, wind) 
(to_fahrenheit(), to_celsius())
tip = compose_tip(30, 60, 40)  # -> "Use sunscreen and hydrate, Carry an umbrella, Beware of strong wind"
```
5) DECISION 
‚Ä¢	Functions to use:
```
with_fallback(fetch_fn, fallback_fn) run_one_query(question) result = run_one_query("Perth weather tomorrow")
print(result["source"])  
```
6) REPEAT
‚Ä¢	Functions to use:
```python
refresh_demo(question, times, interval_s) process_cities(cities, days)
refresh_demo("Perth weather today", times=2, interval_s=10)
```

üéØ Concept Exploration Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: Why does parse_weather_question() output exactly location, days, and units?
AI: Because these three are the minimum required elements for any weather query: where, when, and in what measurement system.
‚Ä¢	ME: If the user only types ‚ÄúPerth tomorrow‚Äù, what should I do with missing units?
AI: Provide defaults (¬∞C for temperature, km/h for wind) and mention that assumption in the output.
‚Ä¢	ME: When CLI args, notebook widgets, and defaults coexist, what should the precedence be?
AI:Precedence should be CLI > Widgets > Defaults.
‚Ä¢	ME: What are different ways to get user input in Python?
```python
AI: input() function, CLI arguments (argparse), notebook widgets (ipywidgets), file input (CSV/JSON).
üõ† Implementation Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: How do I use collect_inputs_once() to gather missing fields in one shot instead of asking repeatedly?
AI: Pass existing partial input, check which fields are missing, prompt once for all, then return a completed dict.
‚Ä¢	ME: Why does normalize_units() need to normalize case and aliases (C, Celsius, ¬∞C)?
AI: To prevent mismatches and ensure consistent downstream logic.
‚Ä¢	ME: How do I create a menu system for user input options?
AI: Use a loop with numbered options and a dict dispatch for actions.
üîç Debugging Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: Why does int(input()) sometimes throw an error?
AI: Because the user entered a non-numeric string.
‚Ä¢	ME: Why didn‚Äôt parse_weather_question() recognize ‚ÄúPerth,AU‚Äù?
AI: Likely due to missing regex or parser rules for the ‚Äúcomma‚Äù format.
```
‚Ä¢	ME: How do I keep asking until the user inputs valid data?
AI: Wrap input validation inside a while True loop with a break only when valid.
```python
while True:
    try:
        num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))
        break
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid, try again.")
```
üöÄ Challenge Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: Can I design a batch mode (CSV) to run multiple queries at once?
AI: Yes, loop through CSV rows and call collect_inputs_once() for each.
‚Ä¢	ME:Can I support fuzzy input (‚ÄúLon‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúLondon‚Äù)?
AI:Use a fuzzy match library like fuzzywuzzy or a custom prefix search.
2Ô∏è‚É£ OUTPUTÔºö
```python
üéØ Concept Exploration Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: Why is a fixed format (Location/Period/Temp/Precip/Wind/Tip/Note) necessary?
AI: To ensure clarity, consistency, and easy grading.
‚Ä¢	ME: When should I prefer charts over plain text?
AI: When showing trends (temperature over days), not just single values.
‚Ä¢	ME: When should I write output to file instead of console?
AI: When results need persistence, reproducibility, or sharing.
üõ† Implementation Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: How does render_summary_block() ensure every field has a value?

‚Ä¢	ME: Why do I sometimes see None when I print?
AI: Because the function didn‚Äôt return anything, only printed inside.
‚Ä¢	ME: Why is my table misaligned? Is it because of missing values or long strings?
AI: Likely due to variable-length strings or missing values.
‚Ä¢	ME: Why do I see too many decimals? How can I address this issue?

‚Ä¢	ME: Can I produce bilingual outputs (Chinese + English)?
AI: Yes, format each section with both languages.
‚Ä¢	ME: How can I implement logging instead of print?

üéØ Concept Exploration Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: Why do we need ensure_schema_safe()?
AI: To prevent runtime errors from missing keys by normalizing every API response to a guaranteed internal schema (defaults for temperature, humidity, wind, etc.).
def ensure_schema_safe(w: dict | None) -> dict:
    w = dict(w or {})
    w.setdefault("location", "N/A")
    w.setdefault("current", {})
    c = w["current"]

    c["wind"].setdefault("direction", "")
    w.setdefault("forecast", [])
    return w
‚Ä¢	ME: Why keep SESSION to save the last query?
AI: For UX continuity (fast refresh/re-run), debugging, and reproducibility without re-asking the user.
SESSION = {"last_query": None, "last_result": None}

def remember(query: dict, result: dict) -> None:
    SESSION["last_query"] = query
    SESSION["last_result"] = result
‚Ä¢	ME: Why does cached_get_weather() improve performance?
AI: It avoids repeated network calls for the same (location, days [, units]), reducing latency and API load.
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=64)
def cached_get_weather(location: str, days: int) -> dict:
    return get_weather_data(location, days)
‚Ä¢	ME: What is the difference between mutable and immutable types?
AI: Mutable objects (e.g., list, dict, set) can change in place; immutable ones (e.g., int, float, str, tuple) cannot. Mutability affects copying, caching keys, and function side effects.
‚Ä¢	ME: When should I use lists vs. dictionaries in Python?
AI: Use a list for ordered collections of homogeneous items (e.g., daily entries). Use a dict when you need key-based access to named fields (e.g., a day‚Äôs weather record).
üõ† Implementation Prompts
‚Ä¢	ME: How do I unify key names between current and forecast?
AI: Adopt one internal schema and map upstream fields to it immediately after fetch.
def normalize_to_internal_schema(raw: dict) -> dict:
    w = ensure_schema_safe(raw)
    # Example mapping hook if upstream names differ:
    # if "temp" in w["current"]: w["current"]["temperature"]["current"] = w["current"].pop("temp")
    return w
‚Ä¢	ME: How do I store both query and result in SESSION?
     AI: Persist both to support refresh and debugging.
def store_session(query: dict, data: dict) -> None:
    remember(query, data)
‚Ä¢	ME: Why do I default forecast to []?
     AI: So loops like for d in forecast never crash; an empty list represents ‚Äúno forecast available‚Äù safely.
‚Ä¢	ME: Can you show a nested dictionary for hierarchical data?
     AI: Use nested dicts to represent groups (e.g., city ‚Üí day ‚Üí metrics).
weather_index = {
    "Perth, AU": {
        "2025-10-03": {"max_temp": 26, "min_temp": 17, "condition": "Sunny"},

‚Ä¢	ME: Why do I get KeyError when accessing a missing key?
AI: The key does not exist. Use .get(), in checks, or call ensure_schema_safe() first.
v = day.get("precipitation", {}).get("chance", 0)
‚Ä¢	ME: Why does changing one dict affect another?
     AI: You likely shared the same mutable object (aliasing). Make a deep copy before mutation.
import copy
b = copy.deepcopy(a)
‚Ä¢	ME: Why do I get UnboundLocalError when modifying a variable inside a function?
     AI: You assigned to a name that also exists in an outer scope; Python treats it as local unless declared. Use nonlocal/global or pass/return values explicitly.
counter = 0
def inc():
    global counter
    counter += 1

        with open(path, "rb") as f:
            return pickle.load(f)
    return {}
‚Ä¢	ME: Can I validate schema to ensure data completeness?
     AI: Yes. Write a minimal validator that checks required fields and returns a boolean or raises.
def minimal_valid(w: dict) -> bool:
    try:
        return w["current"]["temperature"]["current"] is not None
    except Exception:
        return False
‚Ä¢	ME: When are classes better than dicts for complex data?
AI: When you need invariants, methods, type hints, and refactoring safety (e.g., @dataclass for weather records). Dicts are fine for flexible, lightweight blobs.
